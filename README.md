# PowerShell-VMware

Contains a collection of VMware PowerCLI scripts developed during my days in operations.

###PLEASE USE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND TEST THOUROUGHLY BEFORE RUNNING IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENTS.

** I TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ERRORS AND ISSUES CAUSED BY THESE SCRIPTS **

Note: Many of these scripts were written for vSphere 3.5,4.0 and 4.1. They should still work with vSphere 5.x and 6.x, but test them first and look out for any errors such as deprecated functions.
